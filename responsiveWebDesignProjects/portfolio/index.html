        <p>Objective:
    Project S.A.N.E. is a tool designed for locating sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) throughout the Rocky Mountain Region. It integrates the ability to search for by city, county and facility and returns information based on what is passed through. On searching for each of those, the map will re-render to focus on the locations based on the search results.
    
    We also included a place where people can share their stories with other users to build a sense of community around shared experiences.

        <p>S.A.N.E. Provider is a tool designed for locating sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) throughout Colorado and to allow providers to add, delete, and update site information.
    
    Purpose: A search site for locating sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) throughout the state of Colorado. Currently, the only listing of SANE locations is in a PDF on the CO State website that is updated annually. CO SANE Search provides an updated and interactive search of SANE locations and provider update feature. Colaborators: Denise Stark Tina Li Jamie Brooks Ginger Conly Future Additions/Improvements: Adding a search for specific zip code or location Generating a Google map for each location Expanding to other states Adding additional resources based on location

    The Problem:
    People are confined to the specific software their library uses to search for downloadable content. Current software is cumbersome, and it can be difficult to navigate. If you hold cards at multiple libraries you have to do multiple searches, which can also become confusing and time-consuming. There’s often large hold lists for titles and this page offers an efficient solution to see which titles are available.

    Target Audiance:
    People who consume books and audio books in digital format.
    People who are mobile / not confined to one library system.
    Students looking for research material.
    People who do not want to rely on paid subscription services to access e-books, e-audiobooks, and other electronic materials.
    
    The Solution:
    Create a meta search of e-books and e-audiobooks across a variety of library collections.
    
    The Future:
    Next iteration would require authentication through Overdrive and RB Digital to use their APIs.
    Searchable collections would include libraries in the Denver Metro area, with possible expansion to other regional libraries.
    More robust searching and filtering.
    Availability of items and link to record for further interaction (place hold, check out, etc.)

        <a href="https://scrape-gcn-das.herokuapp.com">Scrape Global Cycling Network</a>
        <p>The App:
    Whenever a user visits this site, the app will scrape stories from Global Cycling Network New and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to an application database. The app will scrape and display the following information for each article:
    Headline Title
    Date of Video
    Link to Watch Viedo
    Image of Video
    Notes on Videos
    
    The user is able to save videos for future watching. When the user goes to the saved videos they are able to add a note to the saved videos. This note can be changed at anytime. Also the saved videos can be removed from the saved list.
